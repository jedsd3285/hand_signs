# hand_signs

The author attempts to train several classification algorithms to correctly identify the vowel being alluded to by images of hand signs of seven volunteer MS Data Science 2019 students. This project was inspired by one of the MSIB Capstones that involved an attempt to build a communication system for sign language, and the author's general affinity for image processing and using PCA for supervised purposes. Images were taken on 02-03 August 2018 of right hands of classmates using a personal Sony Xperia phone.

This is mostly academic, but may still be useful. Cheers!
